            It's like having a superpower. I'm talking about PCB design, where you're basically creating these tiny cities of electronics. Then there's circuit analysis, which is like being a detective, but for electricity. And don't even get me started on wiring and building inductors - it's like playing with the very essence of energy. <br>
The best part? One minute you're soldering components, the next you're writing code to make them dance. And when you finally get everything hooked up and that motor starts spinning or that LED starts blinking exactly how you planned? Man, that feeling is unreal. <br>
It's about creating these systems that think and react. Sometimes I'm there, elbow-deep in wires and code, and I think, "Is this how Tony Stark felt?" Because  when you're bringing these creations to life, it really does feel like you're some kind of tech wizard. Mechatronics isn't just an interest - it's like having the keys to reshape the world around you.

            That's where I get to see my code come to life. It's like, you know how in class we're just staring at lines of syntax? Well, I wanted to take that and turn it into something you can actually see and interact with. So, I jumped into web design, and let me tell you, it's addictive. You're typing away, and suddenly boom - you've got this whole visual thing happening right in front of you. It's so fun you don't even realize you're coding half the time. It's more like you're painting with code. One minute you're tweaking CSS, the next you're crafting these slick user interfaces. It's where coding meets art, and I'm all about that blend. Plus, it's instant gratification - you make a change, hit refresh, and there it is. It's like being a digital architect, and I'm here for it.

            Music is not just about vibes for me - it's where my engineering mind gets to play. I'm not just calculating filters on paper; I'm making them sing in real life. You'll catch me serving at church, making sure everything sounds heavenly on the sound team. But that's just the start. I've got my hands in music production too, cooking up tracks across different genres. And when it's time to get the party started? I'm your guy behind the decks. I've even rocked the crowd at UCT Day 2023, the Class of 2024 formal, and other events. Oh, and instruments? Yeah, I mess around with those too - guitar, drums, piano, you name it. It's all about bringing those classroom theories to life and creating something that moves people. Whether it's tweaking EQs or laying down beats, I'm all about that perfect sound.
