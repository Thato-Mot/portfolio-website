        <span class="greeting">Hey There!</span><span class="lebitso">I'm Thatohatsi Motlhamme</span>Mechatronics Engineer with a BSc Eng. from the University of Cape Town, where I excelled academically, earning numerous awards including the Dean's List and Peralex Electronics Prize. With hands-on experience from Mizana Engineering and UCT's Machines Laboratory, I've honed my skills in programming (Python, C, Java), circuit design, and software tools like KiCAD and SolidWorks. Driven by curiosity and a passion for innovation, I thrive on solving complex problems and pushing technological boundaries. Let's connect and explore how we can create transformative solutions together!
